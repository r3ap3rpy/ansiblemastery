### Welcome

This repository holds the course materials for my course on udemy and skillshare.

This course is very long and is intended to give you all the skills to handle a ground up setup of an ansible environment which is based on version [2.9](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/index.html).

This environment consists of:
- linux master (CentOS 8.2)
- windows client (Windows Server 2019)
- linux client (Unbuntu 20.04 LTS)
- cisco router (c7200)

The following guides will be available.
- [Environment](/guides/env.md)
