### Jinja2

This is a powerfull templating engine which is at ansible's disposal to accelerate dynamic configuration generation.
It allows you to create files based on ansible variables and harness the frameworks power.

Check out the *template_jinja2.yaml* for this guidem and the *test_conf.j2* template for a simple headstart.

A more complex demonstration comes from the *jinja_apache.yaml* and *test_index.j2* template file.
