 ### Handlers

 In this first video we see how docker can be installed on a ubuntu machine and make sure the appropriate group memberships are included.

 This is demonstated in the *linux_docker_handlery.yaml*.

 The second video shows you how to install *apache2* on ubuntu and make sure the service is enabled and started aswell.

 This can be found in the *linux_handlers.yaml* video.
